# TODO

the logged in user dashboard:

- as a user when I log in I  see my interview dashboard:
a page with
- create an interview : big central button
- list of my recent interviews : agent name, date, status, token counts

if the user is new: no  list of previous interviews

We will implement the resume interview later
right now I just want this page


- Persona configuration
- pre-existing build error in the login page's useSearchParams()
- centralize status change for sessions an dinterviews with clear rules
